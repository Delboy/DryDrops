# Dry Drops

Dry Drops is a e-commerce website operating in the field of alcohol free beverages.

This fully responsive website was built using the Django framework in Python.

The payment system uses a service called Stripe. To test this system, dummy card details can be used. A list of these can be found [here](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards).

## Design

### Colour Scheme

- I wanted the colour scheme to be similar to the colour of dark ales and wines to fit in with the sites's theme, so the main colour I chose was a dark redish brow, along with a lighter shade and a couple more neutral tones to balance it out.
